I'm a **Senior Principal Software Engineer** (Red Hat) working for IBM on the messaging and data streaming team. 
I have extensive experience with Apache Kafka, Kubernetes, cloud-native applications, and IoT platforms.
I'm co-founder and one of the core maintainers of the [Strimzi](https://strimzi.io) project, a CNCF incubating project for running Apache Kafka on Kubernetes using operators. In my previous role, I worked on different integration projects such as an AMQP bridge for Apache Kafka and Spark, and on the EnMasse messaging-as-a-service project to enable the integration with MQTT.
I'm also an Eclipse Committer for the [Eclipse Vert.x](https://vertx.io) components providing a reactive Apache Kafka client and MQTT client/server, [Eclipse Hono](https://eclipse.dev/hono/), and [Eclipse Paho](https://eclipse.dev/paho/).
I have spoken at numerous national and international conferences about Kafka, Strimzi, and IoT, including KubeCon, Devoxx, Voxxed Days, Red Hat Summit and DevNation.
Finally, I am a [CNCF ambassador](https://www.cncf.io/people/ambassadors/?_sft_lf-country=it&p=paolo-patierno) and I am former Microsoft MVP for the Azure category (for 11 years).
I'm passionate about open source, distributed systems, and helping developers build better messaging and streaming applications.
