I am Principal Software Engineer working for Red Hat on the messaging and IoT team.

I have been working on different integration projects having AMQP with Apache Kafka and Spark and on the EnMasse messaging-as-a-service project about the integration with MQTT. Currently, I am focusing on Apache Kafka and how to deploy and run it on Kubernetes and OpenShift through the Strimzi project in a cloud-native environment. 
I am also committer for different Eclipse projects like Hono, Paho and Vert.x mostly related to the IoT space.

In a previous life I was an embedded developer working with microcontrollers in C/C++, stuff that I try to continue working on in my spare time.

I am really honoured to be [Microsoft MVP][microsoft mvp profile] since 2014 on Microsoft Azure and IoT.

Finally, I am co-founder of the local meetup [Clound Native Computing Foundation Napoli][cncf napoli] and one of the members of the local [DevDay][devday]

When I am not coding, writing a techincal article or blog post, or on a conference stage delivering a presentation, maybe I am playing at Xbox with my son, running, swimming, or watching MotoGP (VR46 fan) and football (SSC Napoli fan) on TV.
