I am really pleased to announce you my new blog!

It was long time I haven't been writing on my old Wordpress based [blog][old blog]; there were a lot of reasons for that.
Busy working, busy traveling, busy with my family, busy exercising, busy with ... you can pick one.
Anyway, it doesn't mean that I am not busy anymore! :-)

Maybe I haven't been having a great "writer" mood for a few months but now it seems to be back.

Starting from today, if you were one of my blog's readers or you are a new one, this is the right place where you can find technical articles about open source, messaging, IoT, embedded devices, cloud, Kubernetes, Apache Kafka, AMQP, MQTT and all the engineering and development stuff I love.

Looking forward to have you here next time for my "first" technical post!
